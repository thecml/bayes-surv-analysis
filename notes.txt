Todos:

- Determine the proper model architecture for the non-bayesian/MCMC/VI/MC Dropout models (Resp.: Christian)
- Use MCMC to estimate the posterior (Resp.: Christian/Martin)
- Model epistemic uncertainty at inference (Resp.: Christian)
- Create an Overleaf project (Resp.: Christian)


Questions:

- How much does the prior matter when doing Bayesian neural network learning?
If we have a lot of data available, the priors matter less.


Experiments:

Data:
- Veterans Lung Cancer
- German Breast Cancer Study Group (GBSG2)
- AIDS dataset
- NHANES
- More with a lot of data (> 10k samples, maybe artifical using an VAE)

All datasets are generally easy to train, but we need to find a decent architecture/training procedure
- Hyperparams opt

Objectives:
- Show that nobay model can provide C-index scores similar or better than Cox/RSF models
- Show that nobay model can show CI's with survival/hazard curves by sampling from the CPD P(y|x,D) (only aleatoric)
- Show that VI model can model uncertainty in predictions (both aleatoric and epistemic)
- Compare VI/MC Dropout in terms of: C-index (performance) training time, inference time
- Compare our approach with Bayesian to SOTA (DeepSurv and BDNNSurv)
